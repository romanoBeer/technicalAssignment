Short summary of your choice of technology stack - why did you choose it and if you were to do it again, would you change anything?:

  I used HTML/JAVASCRIPT/CSS. I am familiar with HTML and CSS, but not so much with JAVASCRIPT, so I had to do alot of research on JAVASCRIPT.<br>
  I do not know REACT at all and that is why I chose JAVASCRIPT. <br>
  If I do this again in the future i will try and make the coding alot cleaner, as to me it looks very untidy at the moment.
